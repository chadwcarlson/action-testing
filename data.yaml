name: GitHub Actions repository auto-updates test file
description: Each day a series of GitHub actions are run to update the data attribute of this file. A scheduled action creates a new branch, and actions connected to that event commit a new line, create a PR for the change, run a test, and then automatically merge the update. The data added is just a string of the current date and time using the moment module.
useCases:
    videos: "Listing all YouTube videos on Marketing site, getting around the YT query cap by doing once per day."
    templates: "Create a daily index for internal + external templates that can be displayed via Hugo in docs and on Marketing site. Collab with A. Hobday to make sure we get all of the data we need here."
    search: "Doc's builds are long, specifically because it's scraping all other sites. Put into something like this, run once a day, curl on builds"
data: []
